			<h3 id="article1"><li>Natural language generation</li></h3>
			<p>
				<big>Machines process and communicate in a different way than the human brain. Natural language generation is a trendy technology that converts structured data into the native language. The machines are programmed with algorithms to convert the data into a desirable format for the user. Natural language is a subset of artificial intelligence that helps content developers to automate content and deliver in the desired format. The content developers can use the automated content to promote on various social media platforms, and other media platforms to reach the targeted audience. Human intervention will significantly reduce as data will be converted into desired formats. The data can be visualized in the form of charts, graphs, etc.</big>

			<h3 id="article2"><li>Speech recognition</li></h3>
			<p>
				<big>Speech recognition is another important subset of artificial intelligence that converts human speech into a useful and understandable format by computers. Speech recognition is a bridge between human and computer interactions. The technology recognizes and converts human speech in several languages. Siri of iPhone is a classic example of speech recognition.</big>

			<h3 id="article3"><li>Virtual agents</li></h3>
			<p>
				<big>Virtual agents have become valuable tools for instructional designers. A virtual agent is a computer application that interacts with humans. Web and mobile applications provide chatbots as their customer service agents to interact with humans to answer their queries. Google Assistant helps to organize meetings, and Alexia from Amazon helps to make your shopping easy. A virtual assistant also acts like a language assistant, which picks cues from your choice and preference. The IBM Watson understands the typical customer service queries which are asked in several ways. Virtual agents act as software-as-a-service too.</big>

			<h3 id="article4"><li>Decision management</li></h3>
			<p>
				<big>Modern organizations are implementing decision management systems for data conversion and interpretation into predictive models. Enterprise-level applications implement decision management systems to receive up-to-date information to perform business data analysis to aid in organizational decision-making. Decision management helps in making quick decisions, avoidance of risks, and in the automation of the process. The decision management system is widely implemented in the financial sector, the health care sector, trading, insurance sector, e-commerce, etc.</big>

			<h3 id="article5"><li>Biometrics</li></h3>
			<p>
				<big>Deep learning another branch of artificial intelligence that functions based on artificial neural networks. This technique teaches computers and machines to learn by example just the way humans do. The term “deep” is coined because it has hidden layers in neural networks. Typically, a neural network has 2-3 hidden layers and can have a maximum of 150 hidden layers. Deep learning is effective on huge data to train a model and a graphic processing unit. The algorithms work in a hierarchy to automate predictive analytics. Deep learning has spread its wings in many domains like aerospace and military to detect objects from satellites, helps in improving worker safety by identifying risk incidents when a worker gets close to a machine, helps to detect cancer cells, etc.</big>
